Vulcand
=======

Vulcand is a programmatic extendable proxy for microservices and API management.
It is inspired by [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) and powers Mailgun microservices infrastructure.

What it's not
--------------
It's not general-purpose reverse proxy - it is focused on microservices and API use-cases.

Features
--------

* Uses Etcd as a configuration backend.
* API and command line tool.
* Pluggable middlewares.
* Support for canary deploys, realtime metrics and resiliency.
